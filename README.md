# MusicVibes

MusicVibes is an adaptive layout I created using the Tailwind CSS framework. You can see the full design by following this [link](#)

## The idea

The inspiration for this project came to me quite **spontaneously**. One day, for the hundredth or thousandth time listening to my playlist, I realized that while mixed listening to different songs, I often switch most of them just because I am not in the "right" mood for them. </br></br>
This is exactly what **MusicVibes** is for.

## Additional libraries

To implement the slider, I used the library [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/). Now it is added through cdn, but if you want to copy the project to yourself and implement the library locally, follow these instructions:

#### Clone repository from git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Luchiweb/MusicVibe.git
```

```bash
npm install --save-dev
```

#### And then expand the `<script>` stop before the closing `</body>` tag

```html
<script src="./node_modules/flowbite/dist/flowbite.js"></script>
```
